### Getting started
We advise to use [Docker](https://docker.com)/[Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for development.\
We also included a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to simplify some commands

Our development container contains some built-in tools like `PHPCSFixer`.
